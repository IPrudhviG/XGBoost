# XGBoost
XGBoost ensemble classification and regression work

1. First Basic XGBoost multi-class classifier.

This is a data of 7 diverse forest cover types(categorical variables) which we are predicting using XGBoost from the features like 'Hillshade(at different times), Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology, Elevation, Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points, Soil_Types etc.,

This data is readily available from sklearn datasets. So we can directly import from sklearn datasets [source - https://scikit-learn.org/1.0/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_covtype.html]
